## Software Development

### 12-factor app
In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called web apps, or software-as-a-service. The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:

- Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
- Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments;
- Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
- Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;
- And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.

Includes guide to:
1. Codebase - One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
2. Dependencies - Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
3. Config - Store config in the environment
4. Backing services - Treat backing services as attached resources
5. Build, release, run - Strictly separate build and run stages
6. Processes - Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
7. Port binding - Export services via port binding
8. Concurrency - Scale out via the process model
9. Disposability - Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. Dev/prod parity - Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
11. Logs - Treat logs as event streams
12. Admin processes - Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
